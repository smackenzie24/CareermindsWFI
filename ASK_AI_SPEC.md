## 1. Architecture overview

Every question passes through two layers in sequence:

```
User input
    │
    ▼
query() — chatEngine.ts
    │
    ├── Local handler matched?  ──YES──▶  Return { text, results[] }
    │                                     (no network call)
    │
    └── NO (needsAI: true)
              │
              ▼
         callWorkforceAI()
              │

              │

              │
              ▼
         Structured AIResponse JSON
```

**Layer 1 — Local engine:** Regex intent matching against static mock data. Synchronous, zero latency, returns typed `QueryResult` objects that `AIChatRenderer` renders as rich UI cards.

**Layer 2 — AI edge function:** Supabase Edge Function running on Deno. Calls Anthropic's `claude-opus-4-5` with a structured system prompt and the full workforce context snapshot. Returns a JSON `AIResponse` object. Used only when Layer 1 cannot answer the question.

Both `AskAIPage` and `ChatPanel` follow this same two-layer pattern. The difference is UI only.

---

## 2. Query routing — the two-tier system

### Entry point

```ts
query(input: string): { text: string; results: QueryResult[]; needsAI?: boolean }
```

`query()` is the single public function from `chatEngine.ts`. It lowercases and trims the input, then runs a sequence of regex checks to dispatch to the correct handler. Order matters — earlier checks win.

### Dispatch order

The checks run top-to-bottom in this order:

| Priority | Trigger pattern | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `headcount reduction` or `layoff` or `redundanc` or `rif` or `let.*go` or `dismiss` | `handleHeadcountReduction` |
| 2 | `(reduce\|cut\|trim\|shrink)` + `\d+\s*%` | `handleHeadcountReduction` |
| 3 | `90.day\|action plan\|roadmap\|plan\|playbook\|priorities` + `workforce\|org\|team\|plan\|upskill\|quarter` | `handleActionPlan` |
| 4 | `what if\|scenario\|lose\|lost\|leave\|leaves\|if we\|imagine\|suppose\|project` | `handleScenarioPlanning` |
| 5 | `retention\|retain\|keep\|flight risk\|prevent\|attrition` + `plan\|strategy\|how\|help\|fix\|address` | `handleRetentionPlan` |
| 6 | `upskill\|close the gap\|training\|learning\|l&d\|develop\|curriculum\|program` + `strategy\|plan\|how\|recommend\|should\|fix` | `handleUpskillStrategy` |
| 7 | `hire\|hiring\|recruit\|headcount\|add\|staffing\|backfill\|open role` + `strategy\|plan\|should\|how\|recommend\|need` | `handleHiringStrategy` |
| 8 | `restructure\|restructuring\|reorganize\|reorg\|team structure\|reshuffle\|span of control` | `handleTeamRestructure` |
| 9 | `benchmark\|industry\|peer\|compare\|market\|competition\|competitive` + `strategy\|plan\|how\|close\|gap\|improve` | `handleBenchmarkStrategy` |
| 10 | `recommend\|strategy\|strategic\|what should\|what can\|how do we\|how should\|fix\|address\|improve\|action` | `handleHiringStrategy` (if dept detected) or `handleActionPlan` |
| 11 | `budget\|cost\|salary\|compensation\|pay\|spend\|expenditure\|total comp\|% of\|percent of\|afford\|expensive\|cheap\|save\|saving` | **→ AI (needsAI: true)** |
| 12 | `misplaced\|wrong role\|hidden talent\|role fit\|career pivot\|internal transfer\|cross.dept\|misfit\|underperform` | `handleRoleFit` |
| 13 | `overview\|summary\|snapshot\|stats\|how many\|how.s the\|overall` (without `skill\|gap`) | `handleOrgStats` |
| 14 | `ready\|promote\|promotion\|near.ready\|90` (without `who need\|risk\|churn`) | `handlePromoReady` |
| 15 | `progress\|on track\|close\|almost` | `handleProgressing` |
| 16 | `churn\|risk\|stuck\|stall\|overdue\|flight\|leaving\|retention` | `handleChurnRisk` |
| 17 | `skill\|gap\|missing\|weak\|strength\|competency\|competencies\|capabilities` | `handleSkillsGaps` |
| 18 | `need\|develop\|behind\|low\|early\|struggling\|far from` | `handleNeedsWork` |
| 19 | `everyone\|all\|pipeline\|show me\|list\|full\|entire` | `handleDeptPipeline` or `handleEveryone` |
| 20 | Department name alone (any of 7 departments) | `handleEveryone` |
| 21 | Person name tokens (≥3 chars, matched against PEOPLE) | `handlePersonSearch` |
| 22 | No match | **→ AI (needsAI: true)** |

### Department detection

`detectDept(query)` runs inside most handlers. It matches department names case-insensitively and has aliases: `eng`/`engineer` → `Engineering`. A department match narrows the result to that dept's population.

### needsAI: true

When `query()` returns `{ needsAI: true }`, the caller (`AskAIPage` or `ChatPanel`) makes the network call to the edge function. The local `text` and `results` fields are empty — the AI response populates them instead.

---

## 3. Local intent handlers

All handlers are in `chatEngine.ts`. They compute against static mock data and return `{ text: string; results: QueryResult[] }`.

| Handler | What it does |
|---|---|
| `handlePromoReady` | Returns people with `readinessPct >= 90`. Filters by dept if detected. Returns `person-list`. |
| `handleProgressing` | Returns people with `readinessPct` in 70–89 tier. Returns `person-list`. |
| `handleChurnRisk` | Returns people flagged `flightRisk: 'high'` or `'medium'`, crossed with tenure and readiness data. Returns `churn-risk-list` or `person-list`. |
| `handleSkillsGaps` | Returns `skill-gap-list` from `SKILLS_DATA`, optionally filtered by dept. |
| `handleDeptPipeline` | Returns `dept-summary` cards for each dept (or a specific dept), showing tier counts. |
| `handleEveryone` | Returns all people (or dept subset) as `person-list`. |
| `handleNeedsWork` | Returns people with `readinessPct < 50`. Returns `person-list`. |
| `handleOrgStats` | Returns `stat-cards` — total headcount, tier counts, manager count, stalled count. |
| `handlePersonSearch` | Fuzzy token match against `PEOPLE[].name`. Returns `person-list` (1–3 results). |
| `handleRoleFit` | Calls `getCrossDeptFitCandidates()`. Returns `role-fit-list`. |
| `handleHiringStrategy` | Returns `recommendation` + `stat-cards` with action buttons navigating to `heatmap` / `pipeline` / `gap-report`. |
| `handleUpskillStrategy` | Returns `recommendation` with upskill actions, top gap skills, L&D partners. |
| `handleRetentionPlan` | Returns `recommendation` + flight risk `churn-risk-list`. |
| `handleScenarioPlanning` | Returns `scenario` cards (2–3 what-if scenarios with current state and projected impact). |
| `handleTeamRestructure` | Returns `recommendation` + manager metrics analysis. |
| `handleBenchmarkStrategy` | Returns `recommendation` using benchmark quartile data. |
| `handleActionPlan` | Returns `recommendation` — synthesises top risks into a prioritised 90-day action plan. |
| `handleHeadcountReduction` | Returns `reduction` — aggregate analysis only. See §10. |

## 4. AI edge function

**Location:** `supabase/functions/workforce-ai/index.ts`
**Model:** `claude-opus-4-5` (Anthropic), `max_tokens: 3000`
**Deployed via:** `mcp__supabase__deploy_edge_function`
**Requires secret:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (set as Supabase edge function secret)

### Request

```ts
POST /functions/v1/workforce-ai
Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": string,   // the user's raw question
  "context":  string    // buildWorkforceContext() output + optional doc context
}
```

The `context` field is built in `callWorkforceAI()`:

```ts
const workforceCtx = buildWorkforceContext();
const context = docContext
  ? `${workforceCtx}\n\n---\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT PROVIDED BY USER:\n${docContext}`
  : workforceCtx;
```

`buildWorkforceContext()` (in `chatEngine.ts`) serialises the full workforce snapshot: org stats, per-dept breakdowns, top skill gaps, churn risk list, manager metrics, benchmark positions, and attrition signals.

### System prompt

The system prompt (constant `SYSTEM_PROMPT`) has four sections:

1. **Ethical guardrails** — seven numbered rules. See §10 for the headcount reduction rules specifically.
2. **Careerminds products** — six services the AI may contextually recommend.
3. **Response format** — strict JSON schema the model must return.
4. **Workforce data context** — appended at call time (the `context` field above).

### Response format

The model returns JSON:

```ts
{
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  text: string,               // 2–5 paragraphs, plain language
  reasoning: {
    summary: string,          // one-sentence core logic
    methodology: string,      // 2–3 sentences on approach
    steps: [{ label, detail, dataPoint }],
    keySignals: [{ signal, howUsed, threshold, limitation }],
    whatWasNotConsidered: string[],
    alternativeInterpretations: string[]
  },
  sources: string[],
  assumptions: string[],
  needsMoreContext: boolean,
  contextQuestion?: string,   // if needsMoreContext is true
  careermindsSuggestion: null | { product: string; reason: string },
  ethicsNote: string | null
}
```

### JSON extraction fallback

Three strategies in order:
1. Parse raw response as JSON directly.
2. Extract content between ` ```json ``` ` fences.
3. Extract the substring between the first `{` and last `}`.

If all three fail, the raw text is wrapped in a medium-confidence fallback `AIResponse` with `reasoning: null`.

### Confidence signal behaviour

| Confidence | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `high` | Answer shown immediately with green badge. |
| `medium` | Answer shown with amber badge. |
| `low` | Answer shown with red badge. `needsMoreContext` likely `true`. A `ContextRequestBanner` prompts the user for missing data. |

---

## 5. AskAIPage — full-page interface

**Location:** `src/components/ai/AskAIPage.tsx`

### Navigation

`AskAIPage` is **always mounted but hidden** (`display: none`) when not active. This preserves conversation state across navigation. The `hidden` CSS class is toggled in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
<div className={nav.view === 'ask-ai' ? 'h-full' : 'hidden'}>
  <AskAIPage initialQuestion={nav.aiQuestion} onNavigate={navigateFromAI} />
</div>
```

`initialQuestion` triggers an automatic submit when the page becomes visible (e.g. when a risk card CTA from the home page fires `onAskAI("Who is most at risk?")`).

### Conversation model

```ts
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  outputs: OutputEntry[];
  activeOutputId: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  mode: ChatMode;             // 'diagnose' | 'plan'
  attachedDoc: AttachedDoc | null;
}
```

Multiple conversations are stored in a `conversations` state array. The sidebar lists them; clicking switches the active one. Each conversation is independent — separate message thread, separate attached document, separate mode.

### Chat modes

| Mode | Description | Suggested prompts shown |
|---|---|---|
| `diagnose` | Diagnostic queries — who is at risk, what are the gaps, who is ready. | `SUGGESTED_PROMPTS` from `chatEngine.ts` |
| `plan` | Strategy and action queries — hiring plans, upskilling, retention. | `PLANNING_PROMPTS` from `chatEngine.ts` |

Mode is set per-conversation and shown as a toggle in the input area.

### Submit flow

1. User submits a question (or `initialQuestion` fires automatically).
2. A `ChatMessage { role: 'user' }` is appended to the conversation.
3. A typing indicator message is shown.
4. `query(input)` runs synchronously.
5. **If** `needsAI: false`: result is rendered immediately from local data.
6. **If** `needsAI: true`: `callWorkforceAI(question, attachedDoc?.content)` is awaited.
7. The typing indicator is replaced with the assistant message and its `OutputEntry`.
8. `OutputEntry.answer` is set from `AIResponse.text`; the full `AIResponse` is stored for the reasoning panel.

### Output panel

Each AI response is also tracked as an `OutputEntry`:

```ts
interface OutputEntry {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  answer: string | null;
  results: QueryResult[];
  aiResponse: AIResponse | null;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

The right-hand panel shows the active `OutputEntry`. Export actions (download as `.txt`, email via `mailto:`) operate on this entry. The email subject line is prefixed with `[AI — human review required]`.

### Missing context detection

After an AI response, `detectsMissingContext(text)` scans the response text against `MISSING_CONTEXT_PATTERNS` — a set of regex patterns matching phrases like "don't have financial data" or "please provide a budget document". If a match is found and no document is already attached, `needsMoreContext` is set to `true` and a `ContextRequestBanner` invites the user to upload a file.

---

## 6. ChatPanel — sidebar interface

**Location:** `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`

A lightweight slide-out panel. Shares the same `query()` / `callWorkforceAI()` pipeline as `AskAIPage` but has no multi-conversation state, no output panel, no document upload, and no export. Intended for quick lookups without leaving the current view.

Messages are stored in a local `messages` array (not persisted). The panel clears on close.

Quick-reply chips at the top show a subset of `SUGGESTED_PROMPTS`. Clicking one submits immediately.

---

## 7. Result rendering

**Location:** `src/components/ai/AIChatRenderer.tsx`

`AIChatRenderer` receives a `QueryResult[]` array and switches on `result.kind` to render the appropriate card.

| Kind | Rendered as |
|---|---|
| `person-list` | Grid of person cards — name, dept, team, readiness bar, tier badge |
| `churn-risk-list` | Same card layout with flight risk drivers and tenure |
| `skill-gap-list` | Skill gap rows — skill name, dept, below-target %, bar |
| `dept-summary` | Department summary cards — tier breakdown donut/bar, headcount |
| `stat-cards` | 2×2 or 4-wide grid of labelled metric tiles |
| `recommendation` | Full recommendation card — title, context, action buttons with `onNavigate` targets |
| `scenario` | Scenario cards — current state, projected state, risk level |
| `reduction` | Reduction analysis card — multi-tab (Alternatives / By Dept / Process / Legal). See §10. |
| `clarification` | Clarification card — question text + quick-reply chips |
| `labeled-people` | Grouped person list under a label (e.g. "High flight risk in Engineering") |
| `decision` | Decision frame card — situation, question, 2–4 options with consequences |
| `commitment-prompt` | Inline commitment capture — summary + save-to-journal button |
| `role-fit-list` | Cross-dept fit cards — current role, suggested fit, readiness delta |

Action buttons in `recommendation` and `reduction` cards call `onNavigate(target: ActionNavTarget)` which maps to:

```ts
interface ActionNavTarget {
  view: 'pipeline' | 'gap-report' | 'managers' | 'heatmap' | 'benchmark';
  department?: string;
}
```

---

## 8. Trust and transparency components

**Location:** `src/components/ai/AITrustComponents.tsx`

These components are rendered alongside AI responses and are not optional — they are part of the contract between the system and the user.

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ConfidenceBadge` | Colour-coded badge (green/amber/red) showing `high`/`medium`/`low`. Clicking opens a popover explaining what each level means. |
| `ReasoningAccordion` | Expandable panel showing the full `AIResponse.reasoning` object — methodology, analysis steps with data points, key signals with thresholds and limitations, what was not considered, and alternative interpretations. |
| `EthicsBadge` | "Fairness checked" badge. Popover lists the signals used (readiness, tenure, skill ratings, check-in recency, manager scores, flight risk propensity) and explicitly states that age, gender, ethnicity, and all other protected characteristics are never factored in. |
| `HumanDecisionBar` | Persistent footer on every AI response: "AI surfaces patterns — people make decisions. Final decisions must be reviewed by qualified HR professionals." |
| `CareermindsCard` | Shown when `AIResponse.careermindsSuggestion` is non-null. Displays the product name and reason for relevance. |
| `ContextRequestBanner` | Shown when `AIResponse.needsMoreContext` is true. Invites the user to upload a document or paste data. |

---

## 9. Document upload and context injection

**Location:** `AskAIPage.tsx` — `extractTextFromFile()`, `PasteModal`, `AttachedDoc`

Users can attach supplementary data (salary data, budget documents, board decks) to a conversation. This is the mechanism for answering financial questions that the local engine cannot answer.

### Supported formats

| Format | Extraction method |
|---|---|
| `.csv`, `.txt` | `file.text()` — full content |
| `.json` | `file.text()` — full content |
| `.pdf` | Text extraction using `FileReader` + PDF parse (best-effort; layout not preserved) |

### Attachment flow

1. User clicks the attachment button (paperclip) or "paste data" in the `ContextRequestBanner`.
2. File picker opens or `PasteModal` appears.
3. `extractTextFromFile(file)` runs; the result is stored as `conversation.attachedDoc`.
4. A banner appears in the input area showing the document name and size.
5. On the next submit, `attachedDoc.content` is passed to `callWorkforceAI` as `docContext`.
6. `docContext` is appended to the context string sent to the edge function: `\n\n---\nSUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT PROVIDED BY USER:\n{docContext}`.

One document per conversation. Uploading a new file replaces the existing one.

---

## 10. Headcount reduction — special handling

Headcount reduction queries trigger a dedicated flow in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 with hard constraints.

### Layer 1 — handleHeadcountReduction

Returns a `reduction` `QueryResult` with:
- `ReductionAnalysis` object — `totalHeadcount`, `reductionTarget` (absolute), `reductionPct`, `deptImpacts[]`, `alternativesToReduction[]`, `voluntaryAttritionRate`, `monthsToNaturalAttrition`
- **No individual names are included.** `deptImpacts` contains aggregate dept-level data only.

The `reduction` card in `AIChatRenderer` has four tabs:
1. **Alternatives** — list of alternatives to forced reduction (hiring freeze, natural attrition modelling, redeployment)
2. **By Dept** — dept-level impact table
3. **Process** — legal and procedural checklist
4. **Legal** — the full legal referral notice

### Layer 2 — edge function guardrails

Rule 7 in the system prompt (`HEADCOUNT REDUCTION — STRICT SPECIAL RULES`) is non-negotiable and overrides all other instructions:

- (a) Never produce or imply a ranked list of individuals for redundancy.
- (b) Always explain the legal framework.
- (c) Offer only aggregate structural analysis.
- (d) Flag disparate impact risk.
- (e) End every response with an explicit legal referral.
- (f) Always set `ethicsNote` in the JSON response.

### UI interstitial

Before rendering the first reduction-related response in `AskAIPage`, a `ReductionInterstitial` modal appears. The user must check a box confirming they understand the AI cannot make individual selection decisions before proceeding. `reductionAcknowledged` state is set to `true` after confirmation and persists for the lifetime of the conversation.

After acknowledgement, a persistent red warning banner remains visible above the response:

> "AI cannot and must not be used to select individuals for redundancy. This analysis covers structural and aggregate options only."

### Reduction detection

```ts
const REDUCTION_PATTERN = /\b(headcount reduction|layoff|redundan|rif|let.*go|dismiss|reduc.*staff|workforce reduction|cut.*jobs|job.*cut)\b/i
```

Applied both at submit time (to trigger the interstitial) and on each `OutputEntry` (to show the persistent banner).

---

## 11. Data interfaces

### ChatMessage

```ts
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant';
  text: string;
  results?: QueryResult[];
  timestamp: Date;
  isClarifyQuestion?: boolean;
}
```

### AIResponse (AskAIPage.tsx)

```ts
interface AIResponse {
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  text: string;
  reasoning: { ... } | null;
  sources: string[];
  assumptions: string[];
  needsMoreContext: boolean;
  contextQuestion?: string;
  careermindsSuggestion: null | { product: string; reason: string };
  ethicsNote: string | null;
}
```

### QueryResult discriminated union (chatEngine.ts)

```ts
type QueryResult =
  | { kind: 'person-list';        items: PersonResult[] }
  | { kind: 'skill-gap-list';     items: SkillGapResult[] }
  | { kind: 'dept-summary';       items: DeptSummaryResult[] }
  | { kind: 'churn-risk-list';    items: PersonResult[] }
  | { kind: 'stat-cards';         items: StatCard[] }
  | { kind: 'recommendation';     item: RecommendationResult }
  | { kind: 'scenario';           items: ScenarioResult[] }
  | { kind: 'reduction';          item: ReductionAnalysis }
  | { kind: 'clarification';      item: ClarificationResult }
  | { kind: 'labeled-people';     label: string; items: PersonResult[] }
  | { kind: 'decision';           item: DecisionFrame }
  | { kind: 'commitment-prompt';  item: CommitmentPrompt }
  | { kind: 'role-fit-list';      items: RoleFitResult[] };
```

---

## 12. Adding a new intent

To add a new local intent (handled without an AI call):

1. Write a handler function in `chatEngine.ts` — `function handleMyThing(query: string): { text: string; results: QueryResult[] }`.
2. Add the regex dispatch case to `query()` **above** the `needsAI: true` financial fallback (line ~1541) unless it requires external data.
3. If the result needs a new visual layout, add a new `kind` to the `QueryResult` union and add a case in `AIChatRenderer.tsx`.
4. If the new kind needs a trust component (confidence badge, ethics badge), add it to `AITrustComponents.tsx` and wire it into the `AIChatRenderer` case.
5. Add one or two example prompts to `SUGGESTED_PROMPTS` or `PLANNING_PROMPTS` so it surfaces in the empty-state chips.

To route questions to the AI that currently fall through to the generic fallback, simply let them hit the `return { text: '', results: [], needsAI: true }` at the bottom — no change needed. The edge function handles anything not matched locally.

> **Scale note:** `buildWorkforceContext()` serialises the full mock dataset on every AI call. If the dataset grows substantially, move to a server-side context-builder or implement selective context (only the relevant dept snapshot). The current approach is fine for ~200 employees but will produce an oversized context at 1000+.
